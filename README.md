Project Goal
To perform a comprehensive analysis of global food waste data and develop an interactive tool for exploration.

Key Objectives:

Explore the Data: Clean, prepare, and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand global and regional trends.

Identify Patterns: Use K-Means clustering to segment countries into distinct groups based on their waste profiles.

Democratize Insights: Build and deploy a user-friendly, interactive web dashboard to make the findings accessible to a non-technical audience.

Data Source: The information was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/food-waste

The original source of the data was UNâ€™s 2021 Food Waste Report https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021

 Project Conclusion & Key Takeaways
Summary of Findings:

Food waste is a global problem, but the primary source varies. The household sector is the dominant contributor worldwide.

Using K-Means clustering, we successfully segmented countries into three distinct profiles, revealing that a "one-size-fits-all" solution to food waste is ineffective.

We successfully developed and deployed a fully interactive web application, transforming complex data into an accessible and understandable tool in order to create awareness about food waste in different sectors around the world. 

Impact:
This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, from raw data to a deployed, user-facing product that can inform policy-makers, researchers, and the public.
